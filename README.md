# SALURBAL FAIR Renovations

THis repo contains codebase for renovation of SALURBAL datasets. There are two folders


- `datasets` contains codebase and metadata for each dataset. No data is stored here only. The data is stored on the UHC server directory `\\files.drexel.edu\colleges\SOPH\Shared\UHC\Projects\Wellcome_Trust\Data Methods Core\Dashboards\FAIR Renovations`.
- `datasets_ref` contains validation code for `datasets` written by RL. To be used to copy results or check results by renovators. 
- `R` contains R functions
- `documents` contains support docs and presentations
