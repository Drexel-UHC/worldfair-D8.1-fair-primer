## Overview {.smaller}

-   Intro: why is digital content important?
-   SALURBAL digital content infrastructure
-   Examples digital content for SALURBAL 1/2
-   Context within SALURBAL II aims

## Intro {.smaller}

Thinking web first and why its important

::: incremental
-   Traditional academia, peer review journals are ideas are exchanged but for non-academics the internet is how ideas are exchanged.
-   To increase impact we have to be able to share our ideas and data via the internet.
-   How do we do this?
-   What could SALURBAL II digital content look like?
:::

## How do we do this? {.smaller .scrollable}

The SALURBAL project has a few unique selling points:

-   comprehensive harmonized multi-national data assets
-   networks across latin america

. . .

Increasing the the online presence of these two selling points would greatly increase our potential impact. To do this there are two main steps:

. . .

-   **Step 1**: Basic Infrastructure
    -   FAIR/machine-actionable renovations of existing datasets
    -   Strict standards for new dataset/codebook formats
    -   Set up online interface for data and digital content
-   **Step 2** Digital content (all hosted on SALURBAL portal):
    -   Bigger initiatives:
        -   Centralized at SALURBALs
        -   Ideation -\> Design -\> Engineering
    -   Analyst/group level content:
        -   Decentralized analyst/group level content
        -   Generated with tools familiar to group Quarto, Shiny, ArcGIS .. ETC

## Step 1: SALURBAL infrastructure {.smaller .scrollable}

Over the past year we have been working on the [SALURBAL data platform](https://data.lacurbanhealth.org/){preview-link="true"}.

-   Renovating our data to be machine-actionable
-   Setting up a online data portal
    -   Primary priority: [open access data](https://data.lacurbanhealth.org/data/catalog){preview-link="true"}
    -   Secondary priority: [digital content](https://data.lacurbanhealth.org/tools){preview-link="true"}

Moving into SALURBAL 2, we hope to leverage our infrastructure to generate much more digital content.

## Step 2: Digital Content {.smaller .scrollable}

Data driven story telling has seen a recent boom.

## Step 2: Digital Content {.smaller}

Below we list a few of the trends in digital content that we have/will adapted for SALURBAL.

-   City Profiles + Automated reports
-   Long form visualization
    -   for telling stories
    -   for explaining models
-   Interactive blogs
-   Dashboards

## City Profiles + Automated Reports {.smaller}

## Fitting into SALURBAL2 {.smaller .scrollable}

-   Aim 1 (data resource + "epi-ish analysis")
    -   Data repository (continuing FAIR data infrastructure, incorporate data, etc.)
    -   Long form visualizations of results or methods
    -   Interactive blogs of results
-   Aim 2 (impact of mitigation/adaptation policies)
    -   Long form visualizations of case studies
    -   Dashboards with HIA results (ability to switch levers)
-   Aim 3 (dissemination/engagement)
    -   "All of the above" but much more targeted
    -   Automated reports \~ City profiles
-   Aim 4 (capacity building & project governance)
    -   ? (Workshops on visualization/programming? Engineering capacity building?)
