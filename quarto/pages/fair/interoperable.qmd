>I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.

Data and metadata is stored in Azure Blob Storage in both CSV form as well as JSON format. JSON is highly interoperable as a REST API for web applications; for example our data portal pulls from this to provide analytics/visualizations. CSV is a common data sharing format in the epi field; any download links or downloaded data from our data portal comes in CSV format as it is more human friendly.
