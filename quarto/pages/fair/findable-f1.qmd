## Within project id - **var_name**

The SALURBAL database is a collection of data items, each item being an individual variable. So within the scope of the project, our primary concern is that **each variable has a unique identifier which we term `var_name`**. For example the data item of the variable *SALURBAL Life Expectancy* is assigned a var_name of *LEAEA*. Within SALURBAL no other variable/data-item has this identifier. 

## **var_name** Rules

1. **`var_name` is a string containing only letters and numbers and does not have spaces or special characters.**
2. **`var_name` is a variable level identifier that should not contain strata information.** For example  SECLABPART**M** and SECLABPART**F** are invalid because they indicate that the variable SECLABPART is for sex (male) and sex (female) strata; the correct `var_name` in this case is just SECLABPART. `var_name` is strictly for the variable and strata is captured in supplementary identifiers detailed in [F3](findable-f3.qmd)

## DOI at collection or item level?

The question of minting DOIs at the collection or the item level is quite philosophical but draw comparison to old school multi-volume encyclopedia. **Do you catalog the encyclopedia as one thing or do you the individual volumes or do you catalog the individual entries within the encyclopedia?**

It really comes down to when other people try to reuse your data, should they cite one particular entry or  are they more likely to cite the entire collection as a whole. **My intuition is that for SALURBAL, if people reuse our data we would be suggesting a SALURBAL wide project citation rather than individual variable or working groups.**

From a global perspective, DOIs are a common way to uniquely and persistently identify digital assets. After we have established a certain level FAIRness we can upload our data to a FAIR data repository (ICSPR) and they will mint a DOI for our data collection. Then we can append our within project identifier `var_name` to the collection/SALURBAL-level DOI to allow item level identification. For example:

- Data Asset: `SALURBAL Life expectancy data`
- Within project unique identifier: `LEAEA`
- SALUBAL project identifier (e.g. DOI): `0.1000/ICPSR/xyz123`
- Globally unique and persistent Identifiers: `0.1000/ICPSR/xyz123/LEAEA`
