##  **F**indable is broken down into four principles 

| Principle    | Verbatim                                                                                                                                                                                   | ELI5  | 
| - | ---- | ---- |
| **F1**      | Globally unique and persistent Identifiers   |  Variables need unique ids  |
| **F2**    | Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below) |  Comprehensive codebooks that cover community needs   |
| **F3** |  Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe  |  Codebooks can be linked to data   |
| **F4**      | (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource |  User interface to search through data/codebooks  |

**The following sections will detail how we implemented each Findability principle F1-F4.**
