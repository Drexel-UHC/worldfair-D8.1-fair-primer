These datasets contain all the countries except Nicaragua.  For each combination of L1AD, sex, and age, 1000 life expectancies were estimated. It is recommended to use the medians in obtaining point estimates. Use 1000 sets of estimations to obtain confidence intervals and p-values (for methodological details, see the reference at the end).  “LE_L1” dataset contains all these 1000 estimations whereas “LEMEADIAN_L1” dataset contains only median life expectancies.",NA,NA,adult_survey_prevalence_02222022.xlsx,Codebook_adult_survey_prevalence_02222022.xlsx,0,1,0,CC BY,0
